# Data Visualization in Physics Experiment
Data Visualiztion in a physics Experiment by using the observations achieved in a lab.

## Description
To know about physics behind experiment or how to perform this experiment in lab [visit here](https://vlab.amrita.edu/?sub=1&brch=282&sim=879&cnt=1).
After the phyiscs experiment whatever the observation we achieved we make a tabluar form of it .Now we have  a datset for our data visualization.
